# Database_Booking-Process-of-a-Sports-Complex
This project requires to build a simple database to help manage the booking process of a sports complex.

The sports complex offers the following amenities: 2 tennis courts, 2 badminton courts, 2 multi-purpose fields, and 1 archery range. Each of these facilities is available for booking for one-hour durations.

Booking is restricted to registered users exclusively. Following the booking, users have the option to cancel their reservations up until the day prior to the scheduled date, with no charges. Nonetheless, if a user cancels for the third consecutive time or more, the complex enforces a Ð„10 penalty.

The database should have the following elements:
